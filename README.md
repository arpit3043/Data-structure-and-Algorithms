# Data-structure-and-Algorithms
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. So how do you identify a data structure that is suitable for a particular task? What is meant by the term ‘Data Structure’? How many types of data structures are there and what are they used for?

I will be covering all the topics inside the domain. I have made a complete list of everything about what data structure is, what are the types of data structures, the classification of data structures, the applications of each data structure, and so on. 
In this repository, I will be uploading all the Daa structures and the algorithms and the blogs related to it. I will be discussing every aspect of each data structure to help you choose the best one in just seconds, even if possible I will be connecting it to any kind of meme, if possible

Thanks !
