# Data-structure-and-Algorithms
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. So how do you identify a data structure that is suitable for a particular task? What is meant by the term ‘Data Structure’? How many types of data structures are there and what are they used for?

I will be covering all the topics inside the domain. I have made a complete list of everything about what data structure is, what are the types of data structures, the classification of data structures, the applications of each data structure, and so on. 
In this repository, I will be uploading all the Daa structures and the algorithms and the blogs related to it. I will be discussing every aspect of each data structure to help you choose the best one in just seconds, even if possible I will be connecting it to any kind of meme, if possible.

What is Data Structure:
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 

How Data Structure varies from Data Type:
We already have learned about data structure. Many times, what happens is that people get confused between data type and data structure.
